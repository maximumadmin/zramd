# zramd

Automatically setup swap on zram ‚ú®

## Reasons to swap on zram

* Significantly improves system responsiveness, especially when swap is under pressure.
* More secure, user data leaks into swap are on volatile media.
* Without swap-on-drive, there's better utilization of a limited resource: benefit of swap without the drive space consumption.
* Further reduces the time to out-of-memory kill, when workloads exceed limits.

## Compiling

* Install `go`, this depends on the distribution you are using e.g. for Ubuntu the command should be `sudo apt-get install golang`.
* Run `make release` to make a x86_64 build, to make an ARM build (i.e. for the Raspberry Pi) run `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 make release`
* A new executable called `zramd.bin` will be created under the `dist/` directory, now you can uninstall `go` if you like.
* Optionally on distributions using systemd, you can install `zramd` by just running `make install`, see below for additional installation methods.

## Installation

### Install on Arch Linux from the AUR

* Install the `zramd` package form the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zramd/).
* Enable and start the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now zramd
  ```

### Manual installation on any distribution with systemd

* Copy the `zramd` binary to `/usr/local/bin`.
* Copy the `extra/zramd.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system`.
* Reload and start the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable --now zramd
  ```

### Manual installation on any distribution without systemd

* Copy the `zramd` binary to `/usr/local/bin`.
* Depending on your init system there are various ways to set it up to autostart, if you are using Raspberry Pi OS, you can simply add a line to `/etc/rc.local` e.g.
  ```bash
  /usr/local/bin/zramd start
  ```

## Usage

* zramd --help
  ```
  Usage: zramd <command> [<args>]

  Options:
    --help, -h             display this help and exit

  Commands:
    start                  load zram module and setup swap devices
    stop                   stop swap devices and unload zram module
  ```

* zramd start --help
  ```
  Usage: zramd start [--algorithm ALGORITHM] [--fraction FRACTION] [--max-size MAX_SIZE] [--num-devices NUM_DEVICES] [--priority PRIORITY]

  Options:
    --algorithm ALGORITHM, -a ALGORITHM
                           zram compression algorithm [default: zstd]
    --fraction FRACTION, -f FRACTION
                           maximum percentage of RAM allowed to use [default: 1.0]
    --max-size MAX_SIZE, -m MAX_SIZE
                           maximum total MB of swap to allocate [default: 8192]
    --num-devices NUM_DEVICES, -n NUM_DEVICES
                           maximum number of zram devices to create [default: 1]
    --priority PRIORITY, -p PRIORITY
                           swap priority [default: 100]
    --help, -h             display this help and exit
  ```

## Configuration

### With systemd

The default configuration file is located at `/etc/default/zramd`, just edit the variables as you like and restart the `zramd` service i.e. `sudo systemctl restart zramd`.

### Without systemd

Just change the arguments as you like, e.g. `zramd start --max-size 1024` or `zramd start --percent 0.5 --priority 0`.

## Troubleshooting

* **modprobe: FATAL: Module zram not found in directory /lib/modules/...**  
  It can happen if you try to start the `zramd` service after a kernel upgrade, you just need to restart your computer.
* **error: swapon: /dev/zramX: swapon failed: Operation not permitted**  
  First make sure that you are running as root (or at least that you have the required capabilities), also keep in mind that Linux only supports up to 32 swap devices (although it can start throwing the error from above when using a high value like 24 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ).

## Notes

* **Avoid** using other zram-related packages along this one, `zramd` loads and unloads the zram kernel module assuming that the system is not using zram for other stuff e.g. tmpfs.
* Do **not** use zswap with zram, it would unnecessarily cause data to be [compressed and decompressed back and forth](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/distributions/1231542-fedora-34-looking-to-tweak-default-zram-configuration/page5#post1232327).
* When dealing with virtual machines, zram should be used on the **host** OS so guest memory can be compressed transparently, see also comments on original zram [implementation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/compcache/).
* For best results install `systemd-oomd` or `earlyoom` (they may not be available on all distributions).
* You can use `swapon -show` or `zramctl` to see all swap devices currently in use, this is useful if you want to confirm that all of the zram devices were setup correctly.
* To quickly fill the memory, you can use `tail /dev/zero` but keep in mind that your system may become unresponsive if you do not have an application like `earlyoom` to kill `tail` just before it reaches the memory limit.
